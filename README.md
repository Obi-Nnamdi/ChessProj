# ChessProj
A chess program made using JavaFX.
Created by Nnamdi Obi and Terrence Hampton for NCSSM's CS4060 "Java with Topics" course.

Compile this function by using a java compiler that compiles with javafx packages on the BoardDisplay.java file.
The Piece.java file is an abstract class that defines the framework of the different chess pieces.
The Board.java file incorporates different chess pieces into a board, and is the backbone for the BoardDisplay.java file.
The BoardDisplay.java file defines the UI through which the uses interacts with the board.

Press i when running BoardDisplay to bring up a debug menu, which includes a list of moves and also a list of variables for each side.
